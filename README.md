# Cider-HOG
HOG stands for Hands On Guide, so this is a Cider Hands on Guide. 
I had a tough time finding a simple guide for making hard cider so this is it. 
It tells you the basic things you need to get started as well as what steps to follow when. 
The app will track your start date and end date plus what yeast you used and what you thought about it.
You can use this to make any alcohol really, replace apple juice for honey and make a MEAD, add fruits and you have a MELOMEL.
Or go wild and make a nice batch of shine, but I am not covering distilling in this HOG.
